        <p>K. Kamaraj, fondly known as "Karmaveerar", was a great Indian politician and freedom fighter who played a significant role in shaping Tamil Nadu and national politics. He was born on July 15, 1903, in Virudhunagar, Tamil Nadu, into a humble family. Due to financial difficulties, he had to drop out of school at a young age, but his interest in public service never faded. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, he joined the Indian National Congress and became actively involved in the freedom struggle. He was imprisoned multiple times by the British for participating in movements like the Quit India Movement (1942). His dedication and leadership earned him a strong reputation in Tamil Nadu politics.</p>
        <p>In 1954, Kamaraj became the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and remained in power until 1963. During his tenure, he brought remarkable changes in education, agriculture, and infrastructure. He introduced the Midday Meal Scheme, which encouraged thousands of underprivileged children to attend school. His government also focused on building new schools, improving irrigation for farmers, and boosting industrial development. Despite his success, he voluntarily resigned in 1963 as part of the "Kamaraj Plan", which aimed to revitalize the Congress Party by asking senior leaders to take up party work instead of holding government positions. This move showcased his selfless nature and commitment to the nation.</p>
        <p>At the national level, Kamaraj played a key role in shaping Indian politics and was instrumental in selecting Lal Bahadur Shastri and later Indira Gandhi as Prime Ministers, earning him the title "Kingmaker". However, he later opposed Indira Gandhiâ€™s policies, which led to a split in the Congress Party in 1969. Despite political challenges, he remained a respected leader who stood for honesty and integrity. On October 2, 1975, he passed away due to a heart attack, leaving behind a legacy of selfless service. His contributions to education and governance continue to inspire generations, and he is remembered as one of India's greatest leaders.</p>
