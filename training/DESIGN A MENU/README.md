#design a menu
I am creating a restaurant menu page using HTML tags such as <h>, <li>, <ul>, <p>, and <img>, along with Bootstrap CSS.

Restaurant Menu Page:
 A structured menu page displaying food items.
 Uses <h> for headings, <ul> and <li> for unordered lists, and <p> for descriptions.
 Includes images (<img>) of dishes for a better visual appeal.
 Styled with Bootstrap CSS to make it mobile-friendly.
